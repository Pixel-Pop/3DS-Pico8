# 3DS-Pico8
This is a work-in-progress homebrew application that allows you to play Pico-8 cartridges on your 3DS.

## Usage
Currently, this can only play a [Hello World] application without any sound.
Click "Cart" in the bottom left corner, then save the image as helloworld.p8.png.
Place helloworld.p8.png into a folder named "Pico8Carts" on the root of your 3DS sd card.
Have the 3DS-Pico8.3dsx in your 3ds folder, then run from the homebrew launcher.
You can press **start** to exit the application.

## Planned Features
- Support for all standard Pico-8 functions.
- Cartridge selection.

## Acknowledgements
